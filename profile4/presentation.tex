  Participation seems to be trending down recently but there was a big
  push between October 2014 and January 2015.
\item
  The project would pass the raptor test as there are multiple people
  running each team.
\item
  I don't think this project would pass the bus test. The documentations
  isn't as detailed as it could be.

\item
  Contributing to both the main process and adding new activities has a
  well documented getting started guide.
\item
  The documentation is well broken up so you only need to look at the
  things for the particular thing you're doing, such as the main project
  or an activiy.
\item
  I would contact the maintainers for whichever porition of the project
  I was working on, either by email or hopping into IRC.
\item
  Each individual portion of Sugar has it's own ruling group.

  Also provide ``Sugar-on-a-stick'' which is a live USB based off Fedora
  that can be booted on any computer to use the Sugar environment.
