\subsection{Rationale}\label{rationale}

We chose the Beaglebone organization as lots of us have used either one
of their products or a similar product like the Raspberry Pi. It's a
really cool company that has lots of potential for helping people get
really cool embedded projects off the ground.

\subsection{Beaglebone Boards}\label{beaglebone-boards}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Beagleboardorg has created several ``boards'' that are typically used
  in embedded Linux applications.
\item
  Their current most popular board is the BeagleBone Black which is
  based off of an ARM chipset and runs Linux.
\item
  The BeagleBone Black can be expanded by things called ``Capes'' which
  are attachments that can provide various additional functionality.
\item
  Their older boards are the BeagleBoard, Beagleboard XM, and the
  BeagleBone.
\item
  Over the years due to embedded technology getting better, their
  products have gotten cheaper and more powerful.
\end{itemize}
